The planner will continue, but you may wish to fix your files accordingly
Parsing and Instantiating...
Warning - the variable:

(app-cpu a1 m10)

...was found in a ground precondition/effect, but was never assigned a value
either in the initial state; or as an effect of an action.  If this was
deliberate, you may safely ignore this warning.  Otherwise, note that
following the PDDL semantics:

- Preconditions referring to undefined variables are assumed to be false;

- Actions with effects on variables that have never been given a value are
  eliminated, as they can never be applied (their outcome would be undefined).

Other such variables may exist, but this warning is only shown for the first.

Warning: zero-duration durative actions
-------------------------------------------------------------
At least one durative action in the domain has a duration of
zero:
	(am a1 m1 l1)
This should be rewritten as an instantaneous action (a PDDL
:action).  The planner will try to do the right thing, and
internally replace it with an :action, with all the conditions
and effects changed to being instantaneous.  But, this is not
guaranteed to be correct, if e.g. you wrote an effect
(at start (p)) later followed by a condition (at end (p)).
If it can't solve your problem, rewrite your domain to
respect the PDDL requirement that durative actions
need to have a non-zero duration.
